    <p>Part 1: “M. Gustave”
      INT. SITTING ROOM. DAY
      The early thirties. A double-reception salon with high
      ceilings and two couches. There are six trunks and eight
      suitcases arranged neatly at the side of the room. Each
      is painted with the initials Mdm. C.V.D.u.T. Outside, a
      light snow falls.
      A tall, blond, forty-year-old concierge stands patiently
      alone surveying the room. He is tranquil, perfectly
      composed, waiting. He wears the faintest hint of
      mascara. He is M. Gustave.
      M. Gustave crosses swiftly to the door and opens it just
      as a contingent of hotel staff arrives together from
      down the corridor. There are two waiters, two footmen,
      two bellboys, and an Arab teenager, small, cheerful, and
      alert, who appears to be some kind of page. He is Zero.
      One of the waiters carries a table, and one carries a
      breakfast tray. M. Gustave ushers them in:</p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Bring the table to the window.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="FIRST WAITER">FIRST WAITER: Yes, M. Gustave.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Bring the tray to the table.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SECOND WAITER">SECOND WAITER: Right away, M. Gustave.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: (pointing to two hats)
      Have those been brushed and blocked?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="FOOTMAN">FOOTMAN: Of course, M. Gustave.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">Pack them in the hat boxes.
      (pointing to a shopping bag)
      Is that from Oberstdorf and Company?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="BELLBOY">BELLBOY: I believe so, M. Gustave.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Second trunk. Who has the tickets? Zero raises his hand.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="ZERO">ZERO: I do, M. Gustave.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Give them to me.</span></p>
    <p>Zero hands M. Gustave a set of train tickets. M. Gustave
      studies them carefully. He nods and points.</p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: These are in order. Wait in the corner.</span></p>
    <p>Zero retreats. M. Gustave strides to the bedroom door,
      raps on it briefly, then swings it open.</p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Good morning, Madame. Your breakfast is
      served. The sitting room is a battlefield
      at the moment, but rest assured, you will
      be en route in precisely --
      (checks his watch)
      -- eleven minutes. You look heavenly.
      Pray be seated.</span></p>
      <p>An immaculately-dressed, eighty-year-old woman emerges
        from the bedroom, nimble, brisk -- and highly agitated.
        She is Madame D. She is followed by two young women, a
        lady’s maid and a private secretary, who quickly join
        the hubbub fidgeting with trunks and rushing to-and-fro
        preparing for their departure.
        M. Gustave waits for Madame D. to sit, then joins her;
        at which point, she immediately leans across to him and
        says in a gravely serious, urgent whisper:</p>
    <p><span data-actor="MADAME D.">MADAME D.: .
      I’m not leaving.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">(puzzled)
      Why not?</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="MADAME D.">MADAME D:
        I’m frightened.</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">Of what?</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="MADAME D.">MADAME D: I feel this may be the last time we ever see each other.
         </span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Why on earth would that be the case?  </span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="MADAME D.">MADAME D: I can’t put it into words -- but I feel  it.
      </span></p>
   <p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Well, for goodness’ sake, there’s no reason for you to leave us if -- </span></p>
   <p><span data-actor="MADAME D.">MADAME D: Is there a priest in the hotel?
  </span></p>
<p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Of course, not. </span></p> 
<p><span data-actor="MADAME D.">MADAME D: There should be. I’ve always said so.
</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: Well, I’ve always profoundly disagreed. The Grand Budapest is no place for clergy. </span></p>
<p><span data-actor="MADAME D.">MADAME D: Come with me.
</span></p>
<p>M. Gustave hesitates slightly. He gestures to the
  tickets and speculates in disbelief:</p>
<p><span data-actor="M. GUSTAVE">M. GUSTAVE: To Lutz? </span></p>
<p><span data-actor="MADAME D.">MADAME D: Please
</span></p>
